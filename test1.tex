EXERCISES
2.1. Your colleague Joe argues that since reliability is the probability that the product operates free of failure for some unit of time and safety is the probability that the product operates free of catastrophic failures, and since catastrophic failures are failures, then a reliable system is necessarily safe. Do you agree with Joe? Why or why not?

2.2. Can a system be reliable but not secure? Can a system be secure but not reliable?

2.3. Can a system have high reliability but low availability? Can a system have high availability but low reliability?

2.4. Consider a queue simulation module M that uses an implementation of an first in/first out (FIFO) queue Q. Using information theory, propose a formula for the cohesion of M and the coupling of M and Q. What information do you need about the implementation of M and Q to compute the cohesion of M and the coupling of M and Q.
