\section{The Traceability Matrix}

Describe what a Traceability Matrix is and why we use it?
 
Answer given:
 
Traceability matrix maps and traces user requirements with test cases. 

It is a document used to ensure that that the requirements defined for a system are linked at every point during the verification process.

It gives us 2 big WINS!

1. It shows a visualization of each REQUIREMENT: and which Classes and Methods IMPLEMENT that requirement. Which classes and requirements bring that requirement to life. 

So when we are writing test cases:
It lets us write test cases that ensure each of the user's requirements are being properly delivered!

2. It makes sure we DO NOT have any "dead" execution paths in our code. It lets us see if there are any classes or methods in the application which are NOT LINKED to delivering a user requirement!
Dead, unsupported, undocumented (not in the PUBLIC DOCUMENTED API), path of execution are a MAJOR source of bugs, errors, and failures.
